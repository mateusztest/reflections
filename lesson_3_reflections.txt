When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It is useful if you want to share your work with others or when you collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This way it's more efficient and you sometimes wouldn't want the changes made in the remote to be present on your local repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

    Forks are clones of a repository made remotely on GitHub, clones are any copies of a repository made with a git clone command and don't have to be synced-up with GitHub and branches are made to be able to easily manage the changes you make on your repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

    I can have access to it while being offline and perform merges.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    I would probably have to use a shared folder or something. Although it would be less convenient since we would have to tell each other what we're going to do if we don't want to mess up anything.
