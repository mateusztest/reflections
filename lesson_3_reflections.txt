When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It is useful if you want to share your work with others or when you collaborate with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    This way it's more efficient and you sometimes wouldn't want the changes made in the remote to be present on your local repository.
