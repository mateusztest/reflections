What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When I initialize a repository .git folder gets created. It contains all metadata needed to track changes made to the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

    Staging area gives you a possibility to only commit the changes you want to be commited instead of commiting every change in the project.
